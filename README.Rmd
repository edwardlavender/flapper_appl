## Introduction

The `flapper` family of algorithms is a suite of mechanistic approaches designed to reconstruct fine-scale movement paths and emergent patterns of space use from discrete detections in passive acoustic telemetry arrays. This repository illustrates applications of these algorithms to real-world movement (acoustic and archival) data collected from flapper skate (_Dipturus intermedius_) tagged in the Loch Sunart to the Sound of Jura Marine Protected Area (West Scotland) by the Movement Ecology of Flapper Skate (MEFS) project in 2016--17. Four analyses are implemented: 

* **A1: Depth use.** The depth-contour (DC) algorithm is used to examine the depth use of a selected individual over a one-month period in the MPA. 
* **A2: Space use.** The mean-position, acoustic-centroid particle filtering (ACPF) and acoustic-centroid depth-contour particle filtering (ACDCPF) algorithms are used to reconstruct patterns of space use for a selected individual over a one-month period in the MPA. 
* **A3: Post-release paths.** The depth-contour particle filtering (DCPF) algorithm is used to reconstruct fine-scale post-release movement paths of two individuals suggested to exhibit irregular post-release behaviour following catch-and-release angling in the MPA. 
* **A4: Coocccurrences.** The ACDCPF algorithm is used to reconstruct fine-scale movement paths of two individuals during a period of cooccurring detections to examine evidence for close-knit interactions versus fine-scale spatial partitioning.

## Prerequisites

The analyses are written in `R` and organised as an `R Project`. For data processing and analysis, the [`flapper`](https://github.com/edwardlavender/flapper) `R` package is required. For visualisation, [`prettyGraphics`](https://github.com/edwardlavender/prettyGraphics) is used, which is a dependency in [`flapper`](https://github.com/edwardlavender/flapper). For quick data summaries, the [`utils.add`](https://github.com/edwardlavender/utils.add) package is used on a few occasions.

## Structure
    
1. `data-raw/` contains raw data for the project. 

    * `movement/` contains raw movement data from the MEFS project:
        * `skateids.rds` is a dataframe that records tagged individuals and their characteristics;
        * `moorings.rds` is a dataframe that records acoustic receiver deployments;
        * `acoustics.rds` is a dataframe that records acoustic detections;  
        * `archival.rds` is a dataframe that records depth observations; 
        * `dat_iprb.rds` is a dataframe that records depth observations around catch-and-release angling events;
         
    * `spatial/` contains spatial data for the study area:
        * `bathy/` contains a 5 x 5 m bathymetry raster (named `bathy_res_full_ext_full_abs.tif`), sourced from Howe et al. (2015); 
        * `coastline/` contains a 1:10,000 coastline layer (named `westminster_const_region.shp`) from [Digimap](https://digimap.edina.ac.uk); 
        * `sediments/` contains a map of sediment types (named `HI1354_Sediment_Map_v2_WGS84.shp`), sourced from Howe et al. (2015) and Boswarva et al. (2018); 
    
    * `process_data_raw.R` processes raw data as required for each analysis. 

2. `data/` contains data for the project.  
    * `movement/`contains processed movement time series (from `process_data_raw.R`) and analysis-specific algorithm outputs; 
    * `spatial/` contains processed spatial data (from `process_data_raw.R`);
    * `tmp/` stores temporary files;

3. `R/` contains `R` scripts that implement analyses.  

    * `define_global_param.R` defines global parameters, such as projections, detection and movement parameters; 
    * `define_study_area_fields.R` defines spatial fields for mapping the study area; 
    * `examine_depth_use.R` implements A1; 
    * `examine_space_use.R` implements A2, supported by `examine_space_use_time_trials.R`, `examine_lcps.R` and `examine_habitat_preferences.R`;
    * `examine_post_release_paths.R` implements A3;
    * `examine_coocccurrences.R` implements A4;
   
4. `fig/` contains figures. 

Note that `data-raw/`, `data/` and `fig/` are not included in the online version of this repository. 

## Workflow 

1. **Set up.** Install project dependences (such as [`flapper`](https://github.com/edwardlavender/flapper)) and set up the `R Project`, including the directory system (as outlined above and in the `R` scripts). It is desirable to initiate the project on a system with a capacity of at least 4 TB (e.g., an external hard drive) as some routines generate large numbers of files. Obtain and process the raw data (via `process_data_raw.R`).

2. **Define global parameters.** Define global parameters via `define_global_param.R` and study area fields via `define_study_area_fields.R`. 

3. **Implement algorithms.** Implement A1--4 via `examine_depth_use.R`, `examine_space_use.R` (together with `examine_space_use_time_trials.R`, `examine_lcps.R` and `examine_habitat_preferences.R`), `examine_post_release_paths.R` and `examine_cooccurrences.R` respectively. 

4. **Examine results.** Examine reconstructed patterns of depth and space use and their implications in analyses of habitat preferences; post-release movement paths and fine-scale spatial partitioning during periods of cooccurring detections for the selected individuals.
